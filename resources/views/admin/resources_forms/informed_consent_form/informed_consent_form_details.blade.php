                        creating an initial treatment plan. During this time, I will have an opportunity to get to know my

                        therapist and to make my own assessment about whether I feel comfortable working with them. If I

                                Therapy requires an extreme sense of vulnerability and looking at painful experiences. As

                                these experiences are remembered, I may experience some uncomfortable emotions, such as

                                sadness, guilt, shame, anger, or anxiety.

                                Because therapy often focuses on unpleasant and painful issues, it may seem like things are

                                getting worse. Remember that things often get worse before they improve.

                        90 minutes long with a fee of $225.00. I am responsible for paying at the time of my session unless

                        prior arrangements have been made in writing.

                        In order for us to set realistic treatment goals and priorities, it is important to evaluate what

                        resources I have available to pay for my treatment. If I have a health insurance policy, it will

                        usually provide some coverage for mental health treatment. With my permission, my therapist will

                        assist me to the extent possible in filing claims if she is an in-network provider for my insurance.

                        I understand that I am responsible for knowing my coverage (including co-insurance and co-pays) and

                        for letting Accepted Therapy Service know if/when my coverage changes. If my therapist is not a

                        participating provider for my insurance plan, I understand that she will supply me with a receipt of

                        payment or superbill, upon request, for services which I can submit to my insurance company for

                        reimbursement. Please note that not all insurance companies reimburse for out-of-network providers.

                        If I prefer to use a participating provider, my therapist will refer me to another mental health

                        professional.

                <div class="col-lg-12">

                    <label for="">I am aware that most insurance companies require my therapist to provide them with a

                        clinical diagnosis/diagnoses. (Diagnoses are technical terms that describe the nature of my problems

                        and whether they are short-term or long-term problems. All diagnoses come from a book entitled the

                        Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel 5th Edition or DSM-5. There is a copy in my therapist’s office

                        that I can look at if I would like to learn more about my diagnosis, if applicable.). Sometimes my

                        therapist may have to provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries,

                        or copies of the entire record (in rare cases). This information will become part of the insurance

                        company files and will probably be stored in a computer. Though all insurance companies claim to

                        keep such information confidential, I recognize that my therapist does not have control over what

                        the insurance company does with it once it is in their hands. In some cases, they may share the

                        information with a national medical information databank. If I want a copy of any report my

                        therapist submits, I can request it at any time. By signing this agreement, you agree that I can

                        provide requested information to your carrier if you plan to pay with insurance.</label>

                <div class="col-lg-12">

                    <label for="">

                        In addition, if I plan to use my insurance, authorization from the insurance company may be required

                        before they will cover therapy fees. If I do obtain authorization and it is required, I may be

                        responsible for full payment of any fees accrued. Many policies leave a percentage of the fee (which

                        is called co-insurance) or a flat dollar amount (referred to as a co-payment) to be covered by me

                        (the client). Either amount is to be paid at the time of the visit via any of the accepted payment

                        methods. In addition, some insurance companies also have a deductible, which is an out-of-pocket

                        amount, that must be paid by me (the client) before the insurance company is willing to begin paying

                        any amount for services. This will typically mean that I will be responsible to pay for initial

                        sessions with my therapist until my deductible has been met. The deductible amount may also need to

                        be met at the start of each calendar year. Once we have all of the information about your insurance

                        coverage, we will discuss what we can reasonably expect to accomplish with the benefits that are

                        available and what will happen if coverage ends before I feel ready to end my sessions. I understand

                        that I always have the right to pay for my therapy services out-of-pocket if I wish to avoid any of

                        the problems described above.

                    records, there is a chance that they may be misinterpreted and/or upsetting to untrained readers. For

                    this reason, it is recommended that if I wish to review my records, I initially review them with my

                    therapist or have them forwarded to another mental health professional to discuss the contents. If my
